    <p><h2>1</h2> Web server( A computer that hosts a website on the internet ) is a computer which is host one or more website. Web Server words means have two things one is Hardware and second is Software. Hardware means a computer whose store inside software and website file (HTML, CSS, JS). Second One is software whose have http server. it's give access to the user of hosted website and what process is follow to accessing the website and here comes the role of http server.</p>

    <h1>How does works Web Server ?</h1>
   
    <p>In web server have hosted website file and http server(software),software is a http server whose get browser request via http request and then http server fetch the file inside the web server. Http server understand URL and HTTP(the protocol how to access the website inside the web server) and http server get access the file via domain name of the websites it stores, and it deliver the content of these hosted websites to the end's user device. The clint get some information to use browser and the browser make http request to the web server where the web server have http server, http server to check the file in hosted website and if got those file which is clints wats, the http server gave file to http response and browser get the file. If http server not get the file they show error 404 to responding the browser.</p>
    
    
    
   <h1>Server Types</h1>
   <p>For publishing website we need to Server Where we hosted the website.<br> Web server are two types <b>Static web server </b>and <b>Dynamic web server</b>.</p>


 <h2>Static Web Server</h2> 
<p>A static web server is a computer with a http server whose serve the website as it is,<br>No   any dynamically changes because in static website have no any database.
</p>
    
   <h2>Dynamic Web Server</h2> 
   <p>

    <!-- apache web server -->
<h1>WHAT IS APACHE ?</h1>

<p>Apache Web Server is a free and open-source web server software that is widely used to host websites on the internet. It was developed by the Apache Software Foundation and is available for a variety of operating systems including Linux, Unix, and Windows. Apache is known for its high performance, reliability, and security features, and it is one of the most popular web server software in use today. Apache supports multiple programming languages, such as PHP, Perl, and Python, and it can be extended through the use of modules to provide additional functionality.</p>

<!-- live server -->
<h1>WHAT IS LIVE SERVER?</h1>
<p>
This is a little development server with live reload capability. Use it for hacking your HTML/JavaScript/CSS files, but not for deploying the final site.

There are two reasons for using this:

AJAX requests don't work with the file:// protocol due to security restrictions, i.e. you need a server if your site fetches content through JavaScript.
Having the page reload automatically after changes to files can accelerate development.
</p>

<!-- ABOUT HTML -->
<h1>WHAT IS HTML :</h1>
<div>
   <P>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.</P>

<!-- HTML ELEMENT -->

    <h1><u>HTML ELEMENT</u></h1>
    <img src="./images/HTML ELEMENT.png" width="500" height="200" alt="element img">

    <p>In the HTML syntax, most elements are written with a start tag and an end tag, with the content in between. An HTML tag is composed of the name of the element, surrounded by angle brackets.<br> An end tag also has a slash after the opening angle bracket, to distinguish it from the start tag. For example, a paragraph, which is represented by the <p> element, would be written as:</p>

  <!-- FELX BOX -->
  <h1>Flex Box</h1>

  <p>Flexbox is a layout model that allows you to create flexible and responsive layouts for your web pages.<br> It makes it easier to align and distribute items within a container, regardless of their size or shape.</p>
  
  

<h3>The main properties of Flexbox are:</h3>

<p>
   <h4>- display:</h4> This property is set to <b>flex</b> to create a flex container.<br>

   <h4>- flex-direction:</h4> This property specifies the direction of the main axis. It can be set to <b>row</b> for a horizontal layout or <b>column</b> for a vertical layout.<br>

   <h4>- justify-content: </h4>This property aligns items along the main axis. It can be set to ,<b>flex-start</b>, <b>center</b>, <b>flex-end</b>, <b>space-between</b>, or <b>space-around</b>.<br>

   <h4>- align-items:</h4>This property aligns items along the cross axis. It can be set to <b>flex-start</b>, <b>center</b>, <b>flex-end</b>, <b>stretch</b>, or <b>baseline</b>.<br>

<!-- POSITIONING IN CSS -->

<h1>Positioning in css</h1>
<p>CSS positioning is a way to control the layout of HTML elements on a web page.</p>

<img src="./images/CSS-Position.png" width="450" height="450">
 
 
 <h4> There are several types of positioning in CSS:</h4>


1. <h4>Static positioning:</h4>
 <p>This is the default positioning of an element.
  It follows the normal flow of the document and cannot be moved.</p>

2. <h4>Relative positioning:</h4> 
<p>This type of positioning moves an element relative to its current position.<br> It allows you to adjust an element's position without affecting the layout of other elements on the page.</p>

3. <h4>Absolute positioning:</h4>
 <p>This type of positioning removes an element from the normal flow of the document and positions it relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
  If there is no positioned ancestor, it positions relative to the body element.</p>

<h4>Fixed positioning:</h4> 
<p>This type of positioning positions an element relative to the viewport, meaning it stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.</p>

<h4>Sticky positioning:</h4>
  <p>This type of positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. It allows an element to be positioned relative to its normal position until it reaches a certain point, at which point it becomes fixed.</p>


<h3>Here's an example of CSS code for absolute positioning:</h3>

```css
.element {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50px;
  left: 100px;
}
```

<p>This would position the element 50 pixels from the top and 100 pixels from the left of its nearest positioned ancestor.</p>

<!-- CSS BOX MODEL -->
<h1> CSS BOX MODEL</h1>

<p>The CSS box model is a concept that describes how elements in HTML are structured and how their content, padding, border, and margins are positioned and sized. It is important to understand this concept when designing layouts with CSS.</p>

<h3>Diagram of Css Box Model :</h3>
<img src="./images/css box model.png">

<p>The box model can be visualized as a rectangular box that surrounds an element's content and defines its dimensions.</p>

<h3>The four main components of the box model are: </h3>

1. <h2>Content:</h2> 
 <p>This is the actual content of the element, such as text, images, or other HTML elements.</p>
2. <h2>Padding:</h2>
 <p>This is the space between the content and the element's border.<br> It can be set using the CSS padding property.</p>
3. <h2>Border:</h2> 
<p>This is the line that surrounds the element's padding.<br>It can be set using the CSS border property.</p>
4. <h2>Margin:</h2> 
 <p>This is the space between the element's border and the neighboring elements. It can be set using the CSS margin property.</p>


<h3>CSS code example:</h3>
```
.box {
  width: 200px; /* sets the width of the box */
  height: 100px; /* sets the height of the box */
  padding: 20px; /* adds 20 pixels of padding around the content */
  border: 1px solid black; /* adds a 1 pixel border around the padding */
  margin: 10px; /* adds 10 pixels of margin around the border */
}

<!--MEDIA QUERY  -->
<h1>MEDIA QUERY</h1>

<img src="./images/mediaquery.png">

<P>The Media query in CSS is used to create a responsive web design. It means that the view of a web page differs from system to system based on screen or media types. The breakpoint specifies for what device-width size, the content is just starting to break or deform.</P>

  <h2>Media queries can be used to check many things:</h2>
  
 <p>width and height of the viewport
  width and height of the device
  Orientation
  Resolution
  A media query consist of a media type that can contain one or more expression which can be either true or false. The result of the query is true if the specified media matches the type of device the document is displayed on. If the media query is true then a style sheet is applied.</p>
